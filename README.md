## Concept

token economy for music creators, secondary creators and members who join in the ecosystem and contribute to its expansion.

- music creators provide original music to ecosystem as a NFT which is called "Origin Token".
- member of ecosystem can create secondary creation as NFT which is called "Fanfic Token" using the original music provided. e.g playlists or remix music.
- secondary creation are sold in the market, and proceeds are distributed among creators, secondary creator
- with nft, it is easy to see who is using the original music and how much they are profiting from the market.
- in order to join the ecosystem, you need to staking token which is called "MTE = Music Token Ecosystem" to contract.
- the staked MTE will be rewarded according to the staking period, and user will receive an incentive for continuing to participate in the ecosystem.
- MTE are provided in pairs with native tokens and can be exchanged in the DEX.
- The proceeds from the sale are locked as a MTE reward and can be withdrawn at any time. locking the proceeds in the contract allows you to control when the proceeds are taxed as income.

## Issues

we create product to solve the following issues in the music industry.

1. **Centralized platform dependence** : you have to depend on the platform to sell music
2. **No profit sharing to the creators** : the platform takes all the profit
3. **Excessive rights protection** : rights protections is hindering the expansion of the secondary market
